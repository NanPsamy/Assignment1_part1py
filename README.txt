Files that may be helpful for assignment 1.

 - graph.py
   Our implementation of a directed graph class.

 - breadth_first_search.py
   The assignment does not use a breadth-first search,
   you should use Dijkstra's algorithm. But the get_path
   function from this file might be helpful.

  - binary_heap.py
   The binary heap we implemented in class.

  - visualize.py
   Converts an instance of Graph() from graph.py to
   the appropriate format for rendering to a .pdf.
   Maybe helpful to visualize graphs when you are testing.

  - heapviz.py
   Converts an instance of BinaryHeap() from binary_heap.py
   to the appropraite format for rendering to a .pdf.
   Maybe helpful to visualize heaps when you are testing.
